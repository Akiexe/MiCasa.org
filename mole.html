        <h4>RECIPE</h4>
        <br>

       <ol>
        <li>Add the chicken to a large pot and cover with enough water to fully submerge it plus 1 inch. Bring it to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 15 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked. Carefully transfer the chicken pieces to a large plate and set aside to cool. Cover the pot to keep the chicken broth hot and set aside for later use.</li>
        <li>Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat. Add ½ of the ancho chiles, ½ of the pasilla chiles, and fry for 1 minute until fragrant, stirring frequently to avoid burning them. Shake off any excess oil from the chiles and transfer them to a large heat-safe bowl. Add in the remaining batch of ancho and pasilla chiles, and repeat. </li>
        <li>To the same pot, add the almonds, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds. Pan fry for 1 minute until lightly toasted and fragrant. Transfer them to the same large heat-safe bowl. In the same pot, heat 1 more tablespoon of oil. Add the corn tortilla and lightly fry for 30 seconds on each side. Transfer it to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything to the large bowl. Heat another ½ tablespoon of oil in the same pot. Add the black peppercorns, coriander seeds, garlic, and cloves, and lightly fry for 1 minute, stirring often. Transfer it to the bowl.Heat another ½ tablespoon of oil in the same pot and add the onions. Fry for 3 minutes until softened, then transfer them to the large bowl. Heat another ½ tablespoon of oil in the same pot and add the sesame seeds. Fry for 1 minute until lightly toasted, stirring often, then transfer them to the bowl. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer half of the softened ingredients along with half of the liquid to a large blender and blend for 3 to 5 minutes on high until it’s as smooth as possible. Pour the blended mixture through a fine mesh strainer and into the same large Dutch oven or pot used for frying. Repeat with the remaining ingredients and liquid. </li>
        <li>Add the Mexican chocolate, chicken bouillon, and salt in the large Dutch oven or pot filled with the strained mole sauce. Heat over medium heat and cook for 8 minutes, until the chocolate has completely melted and the chicken bouillon has fully incorporated into the sauce. Taste and season with additional salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add in the cooked chicken pieces and cook for 2 more minutes to heat everything through. Serve chicken with a generous helping of mole sauce and garnish with sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
